        ## For the Developer/Copilot Agent
        
        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - [ ] Add new activity to the `initial_activities` dictionary in `src/backend/database.py`
        - [ ] Format schedule using proper schedule and schedule_details structure
        - [ ] Convert start/end times to 24-hour format for schedule_details
        - [ ] Initialize with empty participants array
        - [ ] Ensure max_participants is set correctly
        - [ ] Test that the new activity appears in the frontend
        - [ ] Verify teachers can sign up students for the new activity
        
        **Implementation Hints:**
        - Look at existing activities in `database.py` for the correct format
        - Schedule should be human-readable (e.g., "Mondays, 3:30 PM - 5:00 PM")
        - schedule_details needs days array and start_time/end_time in HH:MM format
        - Use the activity categorization system in `app.js` for proper filtering
        
        **Files to modify:**
        - `src/backend/database.py` (add to initial_activities)
        - Potentially update frontend category detection in `src/static/app.js` if needed
