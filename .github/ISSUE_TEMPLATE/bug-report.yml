        ## For the Developer/Copilot Agent
        
        **Debugging Approach:**
        - [ ] Reproduce the issue following the provided steps
        - [ ] Check server logs for any error messages
        - [ ] Examine the specific code path related to the affected area
        - [ ] Test with the mentioned teacher account if provided
        - [ ] Verify database state and data integrity
        - [ ] Test both frontend and backend components
        
        **Common Bug Areas:**
        - **Authentication**: Check `src/backend/routers/auth.py` and frontend login flow
        - **Activity Management**: Check `src/backend/routers/activities.py`
        - **Database Issues**: Check `src/backend/database.py` and MongoDB connection
        - **Frontend Issues**: Check `src/static/app.js` and `src/static/index.html`
        - **API Integration**: Check request/response handling between frontend and backend
        
        **Files to investigate:**
        - Backend: `src/backend/routers/activities.py`, `src/backend/routers/auth.py`
        - Frontend: `src/static/app.js`, `src/static/index.html`
        - Database: `src/backend/database.py`
        - Configuration: `src/app.py`
        
        **Testing checklist:**
        - [ ] Test the specific reproduction steps
        - [ ] Test edge cases around the bug area
        - [ ] Verify fix doesn't break other functionality
        - [ ] Test with different teacher accounts
        - [ ] Test with different activities if activity-specific
