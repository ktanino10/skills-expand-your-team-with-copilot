        ## For the Developer/Copilot Agent
        
        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - [ ] Remove the activity from `initial_activities` in `src/backend/database.py`
        - [ ] Verify the activity name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
        - [ ] Consider any existing student registrations in the database
        - [ ] Test that the activity no longer appears in the frontend
        - [ ] Verify API endpoints handle the missing activity gracefully
        - [ ] Update any hardcoded references to the activity if they exist
        
        **Implementation Hints:**
        - Remove the entire activity entry from the `initial_activities` dictionary
        - Check if the activity name appears in dropdown options in HTML templates
        - Consider database cleanup if there are existing registrations
        - Test the frontend filtering and display after removal
        - Ensure API endpoints don't crash when the activity is missing
        
        **Files to modify:**
        - `src/backend/database.py` (remove from initial_activities)
        - `src/static/index.html` (remove from dropdown if hardcoded)
        - Any configuration files that reference the activity
        
        **Database Considerations:**
        - If the activity has existing registrations, they will become orphaned
        - Consider if database cleanup is needed beyond the initial_activities change
        - The system should handle gracefully if students try to access a removed activity
