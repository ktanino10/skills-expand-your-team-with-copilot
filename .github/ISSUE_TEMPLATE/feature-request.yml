        ## For the Developer/Copilot Agent
        
        **Implementation Planning:**
        - [ ] Analyze the feature requirements and technical feasibility
        - [ ] Identify which components need modification (frontend, backend, database)
        - [ ] Consider impact on existing functionality
        - [ ] Plan database schema changes if needed
        - [ ] Design API endpoints if new ones are required
        - [ ] Consider user interface changes and user experience
        
        **Architecture Considerations:**
        - **Frontend**: May need updates to `src/static/app.js` and `src/static/index.html`
        - **Backend**: May need new routes in `src/backend/routers/` or modifications to existing ones
        - **Database**: Consider changes to `src/backend/database.py` and data structure
        - **API Design**: Follow existing patterns in the FastAPI application
        - **User Experience**: Maintain consistency with existing interface
        
        **Common Feature Categories:**
        - **Student Management**: Bulk operations, import/export, advanced search
        - **Activity Management**: Calendar views, recurring events, capacity management
        - **Reporting**: Analytics, attendance tracking, activity popularity
        - **UI Improvements**: Better filtering, sorting, responsive design
        - **Communication**: Notifications, announcements, email integration
        
        **Implementation Steps:**
        1. Design the feature architecture and data flow
        2. Create/modify database structures if needed
        3. Implement backend API endpoints
        4. Create/update frontend components
        5. Test integration and user experience
        6. Consider edge cases and error handling
        
        **Files likely to be modified:**
        - Backend routes: `src/backend/routers/activities.py` or new router files
        - Database: `src/backend/database.py`
        - Frontend: `src/static/app.js`, `src/static/index.html`
        - Main app: `src/app.py` (if new routers are added)
